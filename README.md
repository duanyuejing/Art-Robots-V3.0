# **Art-Robots**

The language and literature robot project was designed by the team of Li Zhipeng, Duan Yuejin, Yan Fei and other 4 peopleã€‚

By invoking HUAWEI CLOUD resources and AI algorithms, this project can continue to write poems, words, and couplets according to existing beginnings, and ensure that the battles are neat. Finally, different timbres are used to read out the resulting verses.
